In addition, there is a new right-sided PICC line, with tip overlying the right atrium.  No pneumothorax detected. Inspiratory volumes are low and the right hemidiaphragm remains elevated, with opacity at the right base, similar to prior.  Minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region is improved slightly.  No gross effusion is detected on this AP view.  No definite change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Focal opacity the left upper zone represent artifact due to overlap of the first anterior and fifth posterior left ribs. No gross effusion detected on either side, but smaller posterior effusions would not be apparent on this film.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view could help for further assessment of posterior fusions. Continued opacity at the right lung base, similar prior.  This is new compared with ___, but similar the most recent prior study.  This most likely represents atelectasis, but amount in appropriate clinical setting, an infectious consolidation could have similar appearance. Mild patchy opacity at the left base is improved compared with ___. New right PICC line tip overlies the right atrium.  Clinical correlation is requested.

Monitoring and support devices are stable. Increased opacification with a plate like character at the right base, most likely related to substantial atelectatic changes.  In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be very difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and there again is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.

Even allowing for this factor, there appears to be  slight worsening of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Worsening linearly oriented right basilar opacity probably reflects atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia is possible in appropriate clinical setting.  Subsegmental atelectasis at the left base has improved in the interval and a small left pleural effusion is again demonstrated.
