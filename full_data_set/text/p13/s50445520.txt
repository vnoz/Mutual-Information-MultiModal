 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated  // eval for tube position      eval
 for tube position
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 04:46 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube has its tip 11 cm above the carina.  Advancement by
 approximately 5-6 cm is recommended to place the tip at the thoracic inlet. 
 House staff are aware as subsequent imaging confirms satisfactory positioning.
 There has been interval appearance of layering left effusion with retrocardiac
 consolidation suggestive of collapse of the left lower lobe.  A superimposed
 infectious process in the left lower lung cannot be excluded.  In addition,
 there is opacification at the right lung base suggestive of volume loss with
 at least partial collapse of the right lower and middle lobe.  A superimposed
 infectious process cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema.
