 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with DLB cell lymphoma, with acute hypoxia.  //
 Worsening hypoxia
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities
 in both lung apices, notably on the right, have slightly increased in extent
 and severity.  The opacity at the lung bases, left more than right, are
 constant in appearance. Constant size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged
 mild blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small
 left pleural effusion.  The right Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
