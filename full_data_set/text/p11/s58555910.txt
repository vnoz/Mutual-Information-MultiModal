                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and new
 hypoxia  // eval for worsening pna or pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, lung volumes are slightly
 lower with associated crowding of bronchovascular structures.  Even allowing
 for this factor, there appears to be  slight worsening of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Worsening linearly oriented right basilar opacity probably
 reflects atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia is possible in appropriate
 clinical setting.  Subsegmental atelectasis at the left base has improved in
 the interval and a small left pleural effusion is again demonstrated.
